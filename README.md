## Development Breakdown

### 4. Hero Section

* Added animated hero text using keyframes for a vertical word slider.
* Connected UI strings like nav links, social icons, and tech stack to a central `constants/index.js`.
* Styled with Tailwind and GSAP transitions.

### 5. Hero 3D Model

* Added a 3D room model using `<Canvas />`, `<OrbitControls />`, and media queries for responsiveness.
* Optimized the `.glb` file with:

```bash
npx gltfjsx optimized-room.glb
```

* Added particles for visual polish.

### 6. Title Animation, Scroll, and Counter

* Used `react-countup` for animated counters.

```bash
npm install react-countup
```

* Implemented scroll navigation and section animations.

### 7. Showcase Section

* Project cards animate in with GSAP + ScrollTrigger.
* Images and descriptions fade and slide up on scroll.

### 8. Navbar, Logo Showcase & Feature Cards

* **Navbar**: Responsive with scroll detection and active link highlighting.
* **Logo Showcase**: Marquee-style scrolling of technology logos.
* **Feature Cards**: Grid layout using Tailwind, animated icons, and hover effects.

### 9. Experience Section

* Timeline built with `expCards`, animated with GSAP.
* Cards use an interactive `GlowCard` effect based on mouse movement.

### 10. Tech Stack

* Each skill is displayed with a 3D icon inside a `<Float />` wrapper.
* Uses `.glb` models from `techStackIcons`.
* GSAP triggers fade-in and upward motion on scroll.

### 11. Testimonials

* Testimonials mapped through a reusable `GlowCard` layout.
* Responsive design with peer feedback.

### 12. Contact Section
